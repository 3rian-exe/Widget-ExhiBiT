			<h2> A Blog About The Exciting, And Ever Evolving World Of 3D Printing! </h2>
			<p> Welcome! This is my 3D printing blog. <br>
			Here I post a variety of different content relating to 3D printing and its different forms. 
			Primarily FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling), though technically what i have is known as FFF(Fused Filament Fabrication). 
			The former is considered to be an industrial-grade technology whereas FFF is a desktop, hobbyist-level 3D printing technology.
			FDM, caters to part applications requiring high-quality, engineering-grade prototypes that can withstand mechanical loads.
			In the navigation bar, you'll see links to the other pages in my blog. In what's new I post interesting new projects and technologies 
			in 3D printing that has been shared with the community, and a project or two of my own that I'm currently working on or past ones.
			In the gallery, you'll find some pictures of my main printer, my moded Creality Ender 3V2, and some neat prints I have made with it.
			In the store, you can find the filament I use and a phone case that's printed in a flexible filament.
			In the about me tab, you can find an article where I talk a bit about myself, what I love about 3D printing, and a scedule laying out one of my longer prints.
			To the right of this article, you'll find some handy links if you're interested in the hobby.
			<br>
			I hope you enjoy!</p>
